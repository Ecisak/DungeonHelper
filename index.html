            "Darkest Dungeon is about making the best of a bad situation.
            Quests will fail or must be abandoned. Heroes will die.
            And when they die, they stay dead.
            Progress autosaves constantly, so actions are permanent.
            The game expects a lot out of you. How far will you push your adventurers?
            How much are you willing to risk in your quest to restore the Hamlet?
            What will you sacrifice to save the life of your favourite hero?"

    <h3 class="heading-3">Runs</h3>
    <section class="text-section">
        <p class="text"><strong>A wise adventurer prepares... or perishes.</strong></p>
        <p>Within these pages lies the knowledge you seek—provisions to pack, regions to fear, and the curse curios that await your meddling hands.
            The path is cruel, but with foresight, it becomes survivable.
            Know which heroes thrive in the shadows of each realm... and which afflictions bring your foes to their knees.

    <h3 class="heading-3">Heroes</h3>
    <section class="text-section">
        <p class="text"><strong>They are not without flaws... but they are all you have.</strong></p>
        <p>This archive holds the strengths, skills, and scars of the brave. Each hero is a tool of survival, a weapon of will... or a liability to crack.
        Study the roles, master their abilities, and build parties that can endure the horrors ahead.
        </p>

    <h3 class="heading-3">Bosses</h3>
    <section class="text-section">
        <p class="text"><strong>Monstrosities birthed from madness... guardians of ruin.</strong></p>
        <p class="text">These are no mere foes—they are abominations twisted by time, corruption, and cosmic influence.
        Each demands a different approach, a different sacrifice.
        Strike without understanding, and you will feed the soil with your failure.
        Learn their patterns. Exploit their weaknesses... or don't come back at all.</p>

    <section class="text-section">
        <p class="text-section"><strong>In this place, ignorance is a slow death... and knowledge, a razor's edge.</strong></p>
        <p>These hard-earned lessons were paid for in blood and broken minds.
        Here you will find guidance—not to make the journey easy, but to make it possible.
        Learn when to press forward... and when to cut your losses.
        Manage your stress, your supplies, your greed.</p>

    <h3 class="heading-3">About</h3>
    <section class="text-section">
        <p><strong>This is just an About page... really.</strong></p>
        <p>This site was forged as a torch in the darkness—a compendium for those who dare to descend.
        Built by a fellow sufferer of the road, it exists to guide, to warn, and to honor the brutal beauty of the Darkest Dungeon.
        Whether you are new to the madness or a seasoned veteran, may these deeds serve you well.</p>
